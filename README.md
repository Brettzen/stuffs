This is a list of projects that I'm working on to help strengthen my coding skills. Below is a simple description of each project.

# CatClicker
A web app for clicking on a cat from the menu on the left to display it on the right. Keeps track of clicks. This was made with Angular.js.

# FunFacts
FunFacts is a basic trivia app for Android. It was created using Java with the Android SDK and Maven.

# Icon Spin
Icon Spin is a "slot-machine"esque type project using the different Robot Masters from the Mega Man games. Icon Spin is programmed in JavaScript and utilizes HTML5's canvas.

# LogoColorChanger
LogoColorChanger is a simple JavaScript and jQuery project. Its purpose is to change the background of the page when the logo is clicked. The logo will spin to correlate with the new background color.

# TextAdventure
TextAdventure is a demo text adventure reminiscent of the earlier days of computer gaming. It is built in JavaScript. Unlike Icon Spin, TextAdventure doesn't utilize any canvases or frameworks, and all manipulation is done directly onto the DOM.
